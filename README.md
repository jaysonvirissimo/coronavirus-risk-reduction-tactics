# Coronavirus Risk Reduction Tactics
*Warning: The maintainer has absolutely no expertise concerning COVID-19, coronaviruses, or viruses in general. He's just a guy who knows git who thought making a list for his friends and family might might be useful. Some of these tactics were originally inspired by [this LessWrong thread](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LwcKYR8bykM6vDHyo/coronavirus-justified-practical-advice-thread).*

## Wash your hands frequently
## Take vitamin D supplements
Supplementing with vitamin D seems to significantly lower your risk of all kinds of respiratory infection. See [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5692194/), [here](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ped.2017.0750?journalCode=ped), and [here](https://www.who.int/elena/titles/vitamind_pneumonia_children/en/) for corroborating evidence. It doesn't seem to help though, if you are already infected.
## Exercise at home, not at the gym
It [seems to spread](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html) person-to-person and from contact with infected surfaces or objects. Gyms seem to put you are risk for both transmission modes.
## Get enough sleep
## Wrap commonly touched items (door handles, lightswitches, etc...) with copper tape
Copper seems to have [antimicrobial efficacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_properties_of_copper#Antimicrobial_efficacy_of_copper_alloy_touch_surfaces), so covering surfaces with it may kill help sanitize infected surfaces.
## Eliminate non-essential airtravel
## Obtain a one month food supply
This greatly reduces your need to interact with those outside of your household should you need to be under quarantine for an extended period of time like happened in Wuhan.
## Work from home instead of going into the office
## Batch trips to the store
Visiting the store fewer times means encountering fewer people means less chances to get the virus person-to-person.
## Wear nitrile gloves
[According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/home/cleaning-disinfection.html):
> Wear disposable gloves when cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. Gloves should be discarded after each cleaning. If reusable gloves are used, those gloves should be dedicated for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces for COVID-19 and should not be used for other purposes. Consult the manufacturerâ€™s instructions for cleaning and disinfection products used. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed.
## Avoid touching your face
[According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html):
> The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. However, as a reminder, CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases, including: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth...
