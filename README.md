# Coronavirus Risk Reduction Tactics
*Warning: The maintainer has absolutely no expertise concerning COVID-19, coronaviruses, or viruses in general. He's just a guy who knows git who thought making a list for his friends and family might might be useful. Some of these tactics were originally inspired by [this LessWrong thread](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LwcKYR8bykM6vDHyo/coronavirus-justified-practical-advice-thread).*

## Wash your hands frequently
Any time you come into the home, before you eat, or after using the restroom:
* Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap.
* Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
* Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the “Happy Birthday” song from beginning to end twice.
* Rinse your hands well under clean, running water.
* Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them.

## Take vitamin D supplements
* Buy vitamin D3 capsules
* For an adult, take 5,000 IU each morning

Supplementing with vitamin D seems to significantly lower your risk of all kinds of respiratory infection. See [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5692194/), [here](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ped.2017.0750?journalCode=ped), and [here](https://www.who.int/elena/titles/vitamind_pneumonia_children/en/) for corroborating evidence. It doesn't seem to help though, if you are already infected.
## Make your own hand sanitizer
* Obtain Isopropyl alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, glycerol, distilled water, and a container that'll hold at least 10L
* Add 7515 ml isopropyl alcohol 99.8%
* Add 417 ml hydrogen peroxide 3%
* Add 145 ml glycerol 98%
* Add distilled water until the total amount of liquid is 10L

See [here](https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Guide_to_Local_Production.pdf) for a more thorough guide from the WHO.
## Exercise at home, not at the gym
It [seems to spread](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html) person-to-person and from contact with infected surfaces or objects. Gyms seem to put you are risk for both transmission modes.
## Get enough sleep
Getting good sleep [seems to](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/features/immune-system-lack-of-sleep#1) reduce the likelihood of catching the cold. By analogy, it may also do so for the coronavirus.
## Wrap commonly touched items (door handles, lightswitches, etc...) with copper tape
Copper seems to have [antimicrobial efficacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_properties_of_copper#Antimicrobial_efficacy_of_copper_alloy_touch_surfaces), so covering surfaces with it may help sanitize infected surfaces.
## Eliminate non-essential airtravel
Airports (and airplanes) put you in close proximity to large number of people and put you in contact with potentially infected surfaces. If you must fly, consider wiping down surfaces (like your seat, the tray table, etc...) with lysol wipes and bringing hand sanitizer in a bottle that is [100ml (3.4 ounces) or less](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/liquids-rule) that will be allowed past the security checkout.
## Obtain a one month food supply
This greatly reduces your need to interact with those outside of your household should you need to be under quarantine for an extended period of time like happened in Wuhan.
## Work from home instead of going into the office
This should cut down on person-to-person transmission as well as expose you to fewer potentially infected surfaces. Of course, this assumes you are regularly disinfecting your home work area and the others in your household are also following good hygiene.
## Batch trips to the store
Visiting the store fewer times means encountering fewer people means less chances to get the virus person-to-person.
## Wear nitrile gloves
[According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/home/cleaning-disinfection.html):
> Wear disposable gloves when cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. Gloves should be discarded after each cleaning. If reusable gloves are used, those gloves should be dedicated for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces for COVID-19 and should not be used for other purposes. Consult the manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning and disinfection products used. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed.
## Avoid touching your face
[According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html):
> The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. However, as a reminder, CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases, including: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth...
