# Coronavirus Risk Reduction Tactics
*Warning: The maintainer has absolutely no expertise concerning COVID-19, coronaviruses, or viruses in general. He's just a guy who knows git who thought making a list for his friends and family might might be useful. Some of these tactics were originally inspired by [this LessWrong thread](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LwcKYR8bykM6vDHyo/coronavirus-justified-practical-advice-thread).*

## Wash your hands frequently
[According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html):
> Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
## Take vitamin D supplements
Supplementing with vitamin D seems to significantly lower your risk of all kinds of respiratory infection. See [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5692194/), [here](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ped.2017.0750?journalCode=ped), and [here](https://www.who.int/elena/titles/vitamind_pneumonia_children/en/) for corroborating evidence. It doesn't seem to help though, if you are already infected.
## Exercise at home, not at the gym
It [seems to spread](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html) person-to-person and from contact with infected surfaces or objects. Gyms seem to put you are risk for both transmission modes.
## Get enough sleep
Getting good sleep [seems to](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/features/immune-system-lack-of-sleep#1) reduce the likelihood of catching the cold. By analogy, it may also do so for the coronavirus.
## Wrap commonly touched items (door handles, lightswitches, etc...) with copper tape
Copper seems to have [antimicrobial efficacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_properties_of_copper#Antimicrobial_efficacy_of_copper_alloy_touch_surfaces), so covering surfaces with it may help sanitize infected surfaces.
## Eliminate non-essential airtravel
## Obtain a one month food supply
This greatly reduces your need to interact with those outside of your household should you need to be under quarantine for an extended period of time like happened in Wuhan.
## Work from home instead of going into the office
This should cut down on person-to-person transmission as well as expose you to fewer potentially infected surfaces. Of course, this assumes you are regularly disinfecting your home work area and the others in your household are also following good hygiene.
## Batch trips to the store
Visiting the store fewer times means encountering fewer people means less chances to get the virus person-to-person.
## Wear nitrile gloves
[According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/home/cleaning-disinfection.html):
> Wear disposable gloves when cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. Gloves should be discarded after each cleaning. If reusable gloves are used, those gloves should be dedicated for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces for COVID-19 and should not be used for other purposes. Consult the manufacturerâ€™s instructions for cleaning and disinfection products used. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed.
## Avoid touching your face
[According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html):
> The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. However, as a reminder, CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases, including: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth...
